# TrendAnalyzer
 
Trend Analyzer is the tool for analyzing correlations between price changes of different cryptocurrency symbols on different exchanges. If the chart of changes in one symbol is very similar to the chart of changes in another, but at the same time it lags slightly behind, then this information can be used to extract profit from trading.

The tool is pretty "raw" for now and it is in active development. First of all I am going to add more exchanges and symbols. Then I will move the server to the remote host. After that I will make the client UI more user-friendly. And, finally, I will set up an automatic correlations analysis on the server.
