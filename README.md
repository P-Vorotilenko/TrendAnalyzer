# TrendAnalyzer
 
Trend Analyzer is the tool for analyzing correlations between price changes of different cryptocurrency symbols on different exchanges. If the chart of changes in one symbol is very similar to the chart of changes in another, but at the same time it lags slightly behind, then this information can be used to extract profit from trading.

The tool is in active development. I am going to add more exchanges and symbols, improve the application UI and add the automatic analysis system.
